  <h3>Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage</h3>
  <p>
    Here is a linkage that can translate between rotary and linear motion.

  <h3>Pythag Proof</h3>
  <p>
    This is a visual demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem.  To convince yourself that the the two small
    squares add up to the area of the big square, note all the pairs of congruent shapes with the same color.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note the large square is mostly covered by 4 triangles, all of which are congruent to the right triangle in the middle.  
    Let A be the area of the white/green/yellow triangles.
    Take 4 times A to cover most of the large square.  Then the "hole" is the cyan square.  The side of that square is
    (a-b), where a is the larger leg of the right triangle. So c^2 = 4A + (a-b)^2 = 4(1/2)ab + a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + b^2.

    You can create the diagram above as follows.  Take five sheets of notebook paper.  With each piece of paper, fold and unfold
    the paper along the long diagonal, making enough of a crease that you can see the diagonal after folding.
  </p>
  <div id="pythag_fold1">
  </div>
  <p>
    Then fold/unfold the same five sheets of paper following the diagram below.
  </p>
  <div id="pythag_fold2">
  </div>
  <p>
    Next, color in the five sheets of paper as shown below, following the creases.  Then cut out the pieces.

    Finally, take all the non-black shapes and arrange them like the original diagram!

  <h3>Twelve Triangles</h3>
  <p>
    The twelve triangles below all have the same area.  Triangles of the same color are also congruent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The triangle outlined in black has six triangles inside it that share a common corner, which is the centroid.
    As you click the buttons below, the shapes will change, but the area of all shapes will be preserved, and the 
    centroid will stay in the same spot.
