  <h3>Twelve Triangles</h3>
  <p>
    The twelve triangles below all have the same area.  Triangles of the same color are also congruent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The triangle outline in black has six triangles inside it that share a common corner, which is the centroid.
    As you click the buttons below, the shapes will change, but the area of all shapes will be preserved, and the 
    centroid will stay in the same spot.
