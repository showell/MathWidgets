  <h3>Pythag Proof</h3>
  <p>
    This is a visual demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem.  To convince yourself that the the two small
    squares add up to the area of the big square, note all the pairs of congruent shapes with the same color.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note the large square is mostly covered by 4 triangles, all of which are congruent to the right triangle in the middle.  
    Let A be the area of the white/green/yellow triangles.
    Take 4 times A to cover most of the large square.  Then the "hole" is the cyan square.  The side of that square is
    (a-b), where a is the larger leg of the right triangle. So c^2 = 4A + (a-b)^2 = 4(1/2)ab + a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + b^2.

  <h3>Twelve Triangles</h3>
  <p>
    The twelve triangles below all have the same area.  Triangles of the same color are also congruent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The triangle outline in black has six triangles inside it that share a common corner, which is the centroid.
    As you click the buttons below, the shapes will change, but the area of all shapes will be preserved, and the 
    centroid will stay in the same spot.
